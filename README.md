# Learning Python

Some basic python scripts for TRGN 510 [Basic Foundations in Translational Biomedical Informatics](https://www.bioinform.io/site/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) required. I personally recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

## Deployment

part 1
Create a basic python script called circumference.py, and output the circumference of a circle of radius 3 following 2*pi*r, pi = 3.14159.

part 2
Create a basic python script called areaCode.py for printing out the area code 602 for the phone number "602-343-8747".

part 3
Download the file, Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz, from http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens and place this file within a directory called data. 

Create a python script called gene_names.py, and output a list of data under specific order using JSON format.
